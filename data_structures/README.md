# Data Structures
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. Mentioned below are data structures used in python and those which are used in fundamental to all languages.

## Fundamental to Python
- _List_: a mutable ordered collection of elements which can be of any data type.
- _Tuple_: an immutable ordered collection of elements which an contains different data types.
- _Set_: an unordered collection of unique elements which can be of any data type.
- _Dictionary_: a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique, immutable, can be of any type. The key-value pairs are mutable after creation.

## Fundamental to all languages
- Arrays: In python, arrays can be implemented using built-in list data structure or using the array module from NumPy. NumPy arrays are faster than it's list implementation.
- Linked Lists: Elements are not stored at contiguous location, instead elements are linked using pointers. Variants: Doubly Linked Lists.
- Stack: Elements follow last in, first out(LIFO) protocol where the latest added element is eligible to be removed first.
- Queue: Elements follow first in, first out(FIFO) protocol.
- Hash maps: Stores key-value pairs for efficient assignment and retrieval of data. Using key we can get associated the value/data.
