## Data Structures
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. Mentioned below are data structures used in python and those which are used in fundamental to all languages.

**Fundamental to Python:**
- _List_: a mutable ordered collection of elements which can be of any data type.
- _Tuple_: an immutable ordered collection of elements which an contains different data types.
- _Set_: an unordered collection of unique elements which can be of any data type.
- _Dictionary_: a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique, immutable, can be of any type. The key-value pairs are mutable after creation.

**Fundamental to all languages:**
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stack
- Queue
- Hash maps
