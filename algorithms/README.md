## Algorithms
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures that can be followed systematically to produce a desired output. There are several kinds of algorithms designed to solved different problems. Mentioned below are some known algorithms:

**Brute Force**
- _linear search_: Search for an element within an array
- _GCD_: Compute the greatest common divisor for 2 input integers

**Recursion**:
- _factorial_: Compute the factorial of a given integer
- _fibonacci_: Compute the fibonacci number at given position

**Divide and Conquer**
- _binary search_: Search for an element within an array
- _merge sort_: Sort elements in ascedning order
- _quick sort_: Sort elements in ascending order

**Dynamic Programming**
- _fibonacci_: Compute the fibonacci number at given position
