## Algorithms
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures that can be followed systematically to produce a desired output. There are several kinds of algorithms designed to solved different problems. Mentioned below are some known algorithms:

**Brute Force**
- _linear search_

**Recursion**
- _factorial_
- _fibonacci_
- _flatten_

**Divide and Conquer**
- _merge sort_
- _quick sort_

**Greedy Algorithms**

**Dynamic Programming**
