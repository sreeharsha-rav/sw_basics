# Basics of Programming

This repo is a reference to anyone wanting to brush up on the building blocks of programming/coding. All of the examples have been implemented in Python so it is easy to understand.

It's still a work in progress...

## Data Structures
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. Mentioned below are data structures used in python and those which are used in fundamental to all languages.

**Fundamental to Python:**
- _List_: a mutable ordered collection of elements which can be of any data type.
- _Tuple_: an immutable ordered collection of elements which an contains different data types.
- _Set_: an unordered collection of unique elements which can be of any data type.
- _Dictionary_: a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique, immutable, can be of any type. The key-value pairs are mutable after creation.

**Fundamental to all languages:**
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stack
- Queue
- Hash maps

## Algorithms
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures that can be followed systematically to produce a desired output. Mentioned below are some examples of well-known algorithms.

**Searching**: search for a given input element within an array and get back it's location/index within the array.
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

**Sorting**: arrange elements in an array in ascending order.
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort

**Computing**
- GCD: Find the greatest common divisor among 2 numbers.
