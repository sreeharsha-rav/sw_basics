# Basics of Software Programming

This repo is a reference to anyone wanting to brush up on the building blocks of programming/coding. All of the examples have been implemented in python so it is easy to understand.

It's still a work in progress...

## Data Structures

**Fundamental to python:**
- Lists: a mutable ordered collection of elements which can be of any data type.
- Tuple: an immutable ordered collection of elements which an contains different data types.
- Sets: an unordered collection of unique elements which can be of any data type.
- Dictionaries: a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique, immutable, can be of any type. The key-value pairs are mutable after creation.

**Fundamental to all languages:**
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stack
- Queue
- Hash maps

## Algorithms

**Searching**: Search for a given input element within an array and get back it's location/index within the array.
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

**Sorting**: arrange elements in an array in ascending order.
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort

**Computing**
- GCD: Finds the greatest common divisor among 2 numbers
